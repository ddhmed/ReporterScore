# Misuse of reporter score in microbial enrichment analysis

The implementation of novel algorithms and statistical techniques plays a big role in the rapid development of microbiome. However, as a modified new method for microbial enrichment analysis, reporter score was incorrectly used in many articles due to a lack of comprehensive and systematic understanding of the original method by the researchers, leading to a serious snowball effect. Here we describe the reasons for the misuse of reporter score, that is, misunderstanding its plus or minus sign as regulation direction. In addition, we discussed negative impact of this misuse on microbial research and hope this comment will facilitate community discussion on the importance of statistical rigor, informing future efforts to enhance reliable and reproducible research.
